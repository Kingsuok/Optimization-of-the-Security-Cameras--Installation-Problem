ECE650 Assignment 2: Test Extraction

This is a test script to confirm your archive follows the submission
instructions. This is not an exhaustive test for your program, it will
only extract, compile, and run your program with simple test
input. Please ensure that your program works with this script. Conduct
this test in a separate directory to ensure no loss of work.

- copy your archive file to a test directory.
- extract the contents of this archive to that directory.
- add execute permission to test_extract.sh
  chmod +x test_extract.sh
- run the script
  ./test_extract.sh
- you should see your program compile and run with the test
  input. Ensure the output follows the prescribed format.

Good Luck!
